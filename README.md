## About

In this project, I used Next.js and Graphql to create a dynamic listing of Rick and Morty characters.

Some highlights:

- The application counts 2 different class filters
- Has infinite scroll
- Uses Context API
- Based on Atomic Design![Screen Shot 2022-10-19 at 21 44 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59892018/196830478-964388ee-da98-4853-8c55-b43043b2cb11.png)
